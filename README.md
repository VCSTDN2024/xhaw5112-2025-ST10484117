## üõ† Technologies

| Technology      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| üüß **HTML**      | Structure and content of web pages |
| üé® **CSS**       | Styling, layout, and animations |
| ‚ö° **JavaScript** | Interactivity, DOM manipulation, and logic |
| üîó **APIs**       | Data fetching and external integrations |
| ‚öõÔ∏è **React Native** | Framework for building cross-platform mobile applications |
| üîµ **TypeScript**   | Adds strong typing to JavaScript for more robust and maintainable code |
| üñ•Ô∏è **VSCode**      | Code editor used for development with extensions for React Native and TypeScript |
| ‚¨° **Expo**         | Development environment and tools for building, running, and deploying React Native apps |


---

## üíæ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:VCSTDN2024/xhaw5112-2025-ST10480778.git
```
---

## ‚ùì Known Issues & To Be Done (TBD)

- **Filter Selection UI**: Final decision pending on whether to use a slide-in panel or a full-screen modal for the course filter interface. Current version uses `react-native-dropdown-select-list` as a temporary solution.
- **Backend & Payments**: Quote generation and payment processing flow in `CheckoutScreen.tsx` are placeholders and require complete backend integration before production deployment.
- **Styling Consistency**: Global and local style files require a final pass to ensure uniform spacing, typography, and UI alignment across all screens and breakpoints.
